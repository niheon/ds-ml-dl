# Description

In this project, I will be wearing the hat of a data scientist helping policymakers understand the critical impact of COVID-19. My job is to extract the key information regarding COVID-19 from news articles and present it in a digestible way. Going through hundreds of news articles in a day takes a lot of time. I'd rather have an automated tool that summarizes the news articles for me.

I am going to walk through real-world hands-on experience on how to build a news/text summarization tool. Text summarization is an important use case that can be applied to many real-world applications such as legal document summarization, classified document analysis, fake news detection, books and class-notes summarization and so on. I will be using Pytorch to apply deep learning techniques relevant to text summarization.

# Project Outline

1. Extracting news data from the dataset

- Data download
- Extracting news from the dataset
- Data cleanup and processing

2. Building an Attention-based Deep Learning model for abstractive text summarization

- Building a sequence-to-sequence Deep Learning model
- Adding an attention layer to the model

3. Model evaluation

- What is ROUGE score
- Evaluating summarization results with ROUGE score
- Interpreting ROUGE score

4. Model inspection with TensorBoard

- Setup TensorBoard
- Update your code to write to TensorBoard
- Visualize your model with TensorBoard
- Evaluating the trained model with TensorBoard

5. Model improvement through hyperparameter tunning

- Understand and Iterate with different hyperparameters
- Test model performance and improve
- Iterate

# How to Use

The project is divided into five main parts, which build on each other. Hence it is recommended to follow the sections in order, unless you have something specific you want to look up.

# Techniques Used

The project involves processing and understanding unstructured text data using deep learning techniques such as:

- Using attention techniques to develop sequence-to-sequence models
- Cleaning up text data and generating features that are suitable for a machine learning model
- Build a summarization model using Pytorch
- Debugging the model using Tensorboard to help understand model performance over time
- Analyzing model performance trade-offs to determine the best results
