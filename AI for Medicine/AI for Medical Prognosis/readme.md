The ability to carry out daily activities; the risk for complications and associated health conditions; and the likelihood of survival are all part of Prognosis. The normal course of the detected disease, the individual's physical and mental health, the available therapies, and other considerations are used to make a prognosis. The projected duration, function, and description of the disease's history, such as steady decline, intermittent crisis, or sudden, unpredictable crisis, are all included in a full Prognosis.
