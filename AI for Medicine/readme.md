## Description

Diagnosis, Prognosis, Treatment are three steps of determining and curing a disease. Artificial Intelligence(AI) can be used at all three stages.

The process of discovering which disease or condition explains a person's symptoms and signs is known as Diagnosis. The medical context is usually implied when it is referred to as diagnostic. The information needed for Diagnosis is usually gathered from the patient's medical history and physical examination. During the process, one or more diagnostic procedures, such as medical testing, are frequently performed.

The ability to carry out daily activities; the risk for complications and associated health conditions; and the likelihood of survival are all part of Prognosis. The normal course of the detected disease, the individual's physical and mental health, the available therapies, and other considerations are used to make a prognosis. The projected duration, function, and description of the disease's history, such as steady decline, intermittent crisis, or sudden, unpredictable crisis, are all included in a full Prognosis.

The management and care of a patient for the goal of combating sickness, damage, or condition is referred to as Treatment. Restrictions on activity limits are not considered treatment unless the primary goal is to improve the worker's condition through conservative care.

The main objective of this repository is to show case the various use cases of machine learning techniques to detect and treat diseases.

## How to use

This repository contains the projects related to the applications of Artificial Intelligence in the field of Medicine. Various applications of Artificial Intelligence(AI) at the stages of Diagnosis, Prognosis, Treatment are discussed in seperate Jupyter notebooks.Go through each folder or folder of your interest to know about each use case.
