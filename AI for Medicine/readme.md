## Description

This repository contains the projects related to the applications of Artificial Intelligence in the field of Medicine. Diagnosis, Prognosis, Treatment are three steps of determining and curing a disease. Artificial Intelligence(AI) can be used at all three stages. In this repository, various applications of Artificial Intelligence(AI) at the stages of Diagnosis, Prognosis, Treatment are discussed in seperate Jupyter notebooks. The main objective is to show case the various use cases of machine learning techniques to detect and treat diseases.

## How to use

This repository contains three seperate folders each for Diagnosis, Prognosis, and Treatment. Each folder contains Jupyter notebook showcasing the application of machine learning techniques at respective stage. Go through each folder or folder of your interest to know about each use case.
