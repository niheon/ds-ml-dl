This project invloves the exploration of the use cases of AI, i.e. machine learning(ML)/deep learning(DL) in medicine. Considering the predictive power of regression models and the potential of classification models, ML/DL has gained grounds in medical diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. This project involves the three parts -
