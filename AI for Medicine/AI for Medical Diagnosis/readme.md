The goal is to diagnose diseases from chest X-rays using a deep learning model. This project employs a DenseNet-121 model that has been pre-trained to identify 14 labels, including Cardiomegaly, Mass, and Pneumothorax. GradCAM is used to show and highlight where the model is looking and which area of interest is used to create the forecast.
